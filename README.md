# sign-up-form-practice



Make the project similar to the demonstration file for simplicity's sake.

Looking at the demonstration file, I immediately think flexbox.

The body will be the flex container, containing two direct children, one on the left, 
and one on the right.

The one on the left is aesthetic, it contains a background image that does not stretch,
and a semi-transparent black div, containing a logo. have an image and text side by side, then center them.
There is also a subtle credits text at the bottom for the background image.

The container on the right will need to be a column-oriented flex container that will contain
three child divs. The top and bottom will be the same size, the middle will be smaller than the other two.

The top div will contain two text containers. Adjust their position accordingly.

The middle one will be the primary form container,  with a CTA at the top, and six input fields 
with labels. This will represent a mock-up sign-up form.

The bottom will contain the submit button, for finalizing account creation.
There is also a dummy link for if the user already had an account, to log in,
but it seems this has no actual functionality.

Employ clamps, min sizes, and or max sizes. Make credit links work.
